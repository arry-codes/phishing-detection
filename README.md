# Phishing Detection 🔍🛡️

A machine learning-based solution designed to detect phishing websites with high accuracy. This project leverages various features and algorithms to identify malicious URLs and protect users from online threats


## Features 🚀

* URL Analysis: Examines multiple aspects of URLs to identify phishing patterns

* Machine Learning Models: Implements various algorithms including:

    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Neural Networks

* Feature Extraction: Analyzes URL structure, domain information, and content features

* Real-time Prediction: Using our Chrome Extension "PhishGuard"



## Setup Instructions 💻

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arry-codes/phishing-detection.git
cd phishing-detection
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the file *app.py*


## Dataset

* The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing:
    - Legitimate websites from Alexa top sites
    - Known phishing URLs from PhishTank and other sources
    - Various URL and content-based features

## Results
